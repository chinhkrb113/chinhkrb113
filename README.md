## Hi, I'm Chinh - Software Architect 👋

### Code is a tool. Mindset is the real value.  
*Code là công cụ, tư duy mới là giá trị cốt lõi.*

I care about building systems that are **clear, resilient, and designed to evolve**.

## 🧭 Principles

- Design for change, not for perfection  
- Simplicity scales better than complexity  
- Architecture is about decisions, not diagrams  
- Clear boundaries create fast-moving systems  
- Build for the long term, deliver in small steps  
- If it’s hard to explain, it’s not ready

⭐ Build less, think more. Ship with intent.
